## Colour palette

These are JCU brand colours.

### Primary palette

The primary colour blue is the colour displayed most frequently across the
website.  It can be used to separate content, create emphasis, highlight links
and headers. To create contrast between elements,  lighter or darker tones of
the primary color can be used. The contrast between lighter and darker tones
helps show division between surfaces, sections and elements.

<div class="bg-primary">
  &nbsp;
</div>

### Secondary palette

The secondary colour (yellow) is complementary to the primary color. It should
contrast with elements that surround it and be applied sparingly as an accent.
It is best used for buttons, sliders, text selection and progress bars.

<div class="bg-warning">

</div>

### Additional palette

There are two colours in the additional colour palette: green and pink.
Additional colours are used more sparingly in smaller elements such as focus
state, confirmation and error messages.

<div class="bg-success">
  &nbsp;
</div>
<div class="bg-danger">
  &nbsp;
</div>

### Greyscale palette

## Accessibility

Text that appears on coloured backgrounds should be legible and meet
accessibility standards. Only these combinations of background and text colour
should be used as other combinations may not be compliant. The Web Content
Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.0) level AA requires a contrast ratio of
4.5:1 for normal text and a 3:1 ratio for large text.
